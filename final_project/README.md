This is my prototype and submission for my Information Visualization final project. 

The folder 'idea' contains the inspiration for the types of visualizations I would like to create. This data comes from a paper published in Scientific American, which investigates the tendencies for certain foods to be paired together (in recipes) across different regions of the world. 

I chose this dataset because it involves many categorical as well as numerical attributes which may be visualized in a variety of ways. I would like to have at least two types of visualizations - one representing a weighted network representation of ingredients and shared compounds, and another portraying some kind of feel for prevalence of certain foods in different regions of the world. I see an opportunity to use geospatial components to visualize information overlaid onto a map. 

I have worked with the data in 'data/ingr_comp' previously to visualize a network of chemical compounds shared between ingredients. However, this visualization was implemented with pygraphviz (Python) and I feel that D3 would add more visual appeal. Additionally, I have not used yet worked with the data from 'data/scirep-cuisines-detail' yet and I am looking forward to incorporating this into a larger visualization as well.
