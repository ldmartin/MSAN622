        <h3><b>Data Preprocessing</b></h3>
        <h5>
            Since the dataset in it's raw form was a simple text file with each row representing a cuisine, much work
            was done in the preprocessing phase in order to manipulate this data for use in the three visualizations.
            The majority of preprocessing was done in python, with small bits of analysis performed in R. Specifically,
            the dataset was decomposed into many smaller datasets which were able to be called from D3 and javascript
            functions. In the case of the barchart and network visualizations, there exist one CSV and one JSON file
            per country. These files are in turn called upon depending on the user clicked country in the interactive
            map visualization. All preprocessing code can be found in the
            <a href="https://github.com/ldmartin/MSAN622/tree/gh-pages/final_project/finalProject/code">code</a> section of my
            GitHub repository.

            <h3><b>Interactivity</b></h3>
            <h5>
                Upon entering the visualization webpage, the user is presented with an interactive map. The countries
                that are shaded black correspond to countries which I have recipe information for. The remaining
                countries are shaded grey to signify that they are not part of the interactive visualization. When the
                user hovers over a grey shaded country, the country turns red and a tooltip will display with the
                country name. When the user hovers over a black shaded country, the country turns red and a tooltip
                displays the country name as well as the ingredient occurring most frequently in recipes for that
                country.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                When the user clicks on a grey shaded country, nothing will happen; however, when a user clicks on a
                black shaded country, two new visualizations are generated and the user is
                scrolled down the page to the first of these visualizations (discussed below).
            </h5>
            <h3><b>Techniques</b></h3>
            <h5>
                This visual was implemented using the <a href="http://datamaps.github.io/">DataMaps</a> D3 package. I
                have modified the javascript default code in the following ways:
                <p></p>
                <li>Custom coloring for countries as either black or grey</li>
                <li>Using 'equirectangular' map layout instead of the standard mercator projection</li>
                <li>Red highlight of country on user mouseover</li>
                <li>Custom tooltip displaying country name and most popular ingredient when applicable</li>
                <li>Generation of new charts on user click of country</li>
                <p></p>
                In addition to these standard javascript formatting changes, a bit of data manipulation had to take
                place. Because the DataMaps package does not allow for CSV reading within the map generation function,
                I defined variables within this function containing country and ingredient information. The first
                variable defined contained the list of countries which I had data for (displayed as black on map) and
                the second variable was a dictionary-like object where the keys were countries and the values were
                the most popular ingredient (displayed in the tooltip). Although hard-coding is never desirable,
                it was trivial in this case
                because I only had data for 17 countries. Finding the most popular ingredient for each country was
                performed as a preprocessing step in python.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                The lie factor of this visual is low and possibly only occurs in the equirectangular projection used
                since the world is being mapped from a sphere to a rectangle. However, I believe the equirectangular
                projection does a better job of minimizing the lie factor over the default mercator projection. The data
                to ink ratio is low for this visual because the data pertains to ony a small amount of countries. I
                have chosen to ignore this fact because I wanted to present the user with a complete picture of the
                world to give context which would be lost if only the 17 countries with data were presented. Similarly,
                the data to ink ratio is low because this visual takes up the majority of the page and presents the user
                with information not pertaining to the dataset at all. For example, on user mouseover of grey shaded
                countries, the tooltip still displays the country name. Again, even with the decrease in data density,
                these attributes were kept to maintain the context of the dataset and allow the user to visualize
                the regions of the world which are being depicted throughout the interactive visualization.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                The sole purpose of this visual is a depiction of context for the user. This visual serves as the
                anchor of the project in that the user chooses what information they would like to be presented with
                by interacting with this map. The user is able to see from this visual that countries in similar
                regions of the world have similar ingredients comprising cuisines. It is also important to present this
                information as a complete map in order to show the user immediately that the data being presented to
                them has an important underlying geospacial component.

            <h3><b>Interactivity</b></h3>
            <h5>
                This visualization is generated based on the country the user has clicked on in the interactive map.
                This barchart presents the ten most common occurring <i>pairs</i> of ingredients in recipes for that
                country. The bar height is the percent of all recipes that pair occurred in. Because each country has
                a vastly different number of recipes compiled, the number of recipes used in analysis is presented
                above the barchart. This serves to decrease the lie factor when switching between countries within the
                visualization.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                When the user hovers over a bar in the chart, the bar fills to red. I had initially had a tooltip
                displaying the exact percent as well but I chose to remove this to increase simplicity of the visual.
                This visual is meant to give the user an overall picture of common pairings rather than present them
                with specifics about each pair. Because all recipes were scraped from online sites, I did not want this
                visual to be interpreted as a full coverage of all cuisines in that country, but rather a rough
                depiction of what was common within the data I had.
            </h5>
            <h3><b>Techniques</b></h3>
            <h5>
                The data for this chart is read in from multiple CSV files containing columns "ingredient pairs" and
                "percent". There exists one CSV file per country, and this file is called corresponding to the country
                clicked on in the initial map visualization. Each row of the CSV file maps to a bar on the barchart, with
                the x-axis label coming from the "ingredient pairs" column and the height of the bar coming from the
                column "percent". Each CSV file has been generated in the data preprocessing step in python.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                As previously mentioned, the lie factor in this chart is apparent when transitioning between countries.
                Because every country has a different number of recipes in the dataset (ranging from 9 to over 40,000),
                when new barcharts are displayed, the user could get the illusion that the number of recipes certain
                ingredient pairings appear in is the same across countries because the percentages are the same. The
                data to ink ratio and data densities are higher. I have removed unnecesary grid lines, lightened the
                tick marks, and only included percentages on the y-axis every 20% in order to increase simplicity of
                the chart. Additionally, I have removed tool tips and included a red highlight on user hoer over for
                emphasis.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                This visual was included to give the user an idea of how ingredients coexist in cuisines across
                countries. It is purposefully the second visual presented because it expands minimally from the
                ingredient information presented in the interactive map. Each subsequent visual is meant to give the
                user a more broad look at ingredients within cuisines. Therefore, the map introduces the most popular
                ingredient, the barchart introduces commonly paired ingredients, and the last visual portrays the
                connectivity of all ingredients within cuisines.

            <h3><b>Interactivity</b></h3>
            <h5>
                This is the second visual generated when the user clicks on a country of the interactive map. The user
                is presented with a network representing the coexistence of different ingredients within all recipes
                of that country. Each node represents an ingredient and two ingredients are connected with a line if
                they exist in a recipe together. This visual serves to give the user a more in-depth look at how
                prevalent certain ingredients are within cuisines for a given country.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                When the user hovers over a node, they are presented with the ingredient represented by that node.
                The user may click on a node to highlight every other node which is linked with the selected node.
                The selected node will grow in size and turn red, while every connected node will turn red as well.
                Additionally, all nodes which are not selected will fade to grey in order to draw greater contrast
                between connected and non-connected nodes. The user may click the selected node again to reset the
                visual to it's initial state.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                Because this visual aims to show the user how connected certain ingredients are within cuisines, it is
                important for the user to be able to see how many edges emanate from each node. For the nodes existing
                in the center of the network, this may be challenging. In order to fix this problem, the user can drag
                any node in the network to a different point on the page in which they can better view the edges for
                that node. When the user releases the node, the network bounces back to it's initial state.
            </h5>
            <h3><b>Techniques</b></h3>
            <h5>
                Data for this visualization was the most challenging to encode, as the format for generating networks
                in D3 takes as input a JSON object with two elements. The first element contains encoding information to
                generate the names of each node and the second element encodes the weights between nodes, when necessary.
                In most cases, this manipulation was performed in python by simply transforming the dataset to sparse
                matrix form, then altering the format to the JSON object needed.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                Problems arise with this technique when
                the network is too connected or contains too many nodes. I visually identified that networks were too
                crowded when more than 100 recipes were being visualized. I have conducted a thresholding step in these
                cases to only show significant connections in the network. The network visualization is reduced to a
                reasonable size by selecting only nodes which appear in more than 50 recipes with another ingredient.
                Thus, the "weights" between nodes dictate whether that node should be visualized.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                In thresholding certain countries' networks, the lie factor is greatly increased because some ingredients
                are no longer represented in the network. Similarly, of the nodes that do appear in the network,
                connections will only be drawn between ones existing in over 50 recipes together. This means certain
                nodes visualized <i>could</i> exist in recipes together, but will not be connected in the visualization.
                The data to ink ratio and data density ratios remain high because there is no extraneous information
                presented in the network. I have increased the data to ink ratio by displaying node labels only on
                user hoverover.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                Since my main inspiration for this project was another network visualization, this piece was what I spent
                most work on. I believe it gives the user the most amount of information about cuisines for the
                selected country because the data density ratio is so high. Users are able to get an overall picture of how
                ingredients exist together in cuisines by interacting with this network. It especially allows the user
                to visualize how prevalent certain ingredients are by highlighting connected nodes when one node is clicked on.

            <p>
                The final project only has slight changes made from the prototype. The plots, layout, and interactivity
                are exactly the same; however, I have modified the color scheme due to feedback that colors used to
                highlight elements should be consistent across graphics. Thus I have chosen to use red as the
                highlighting color across all visuals. All other colors used are light and more neutral so as not
                to overcrowd the visual with more noise.

            <p>
                Most challenges for this project came in not fully understanding javascript and how to make D3 interact
                with outside data. This led me to do a great amount of work outside of D3 and in Python. I ended up
                hard-coding many variables with data because I couldn't figure out how to load it in D3 and assign it
                to a variable to use much later in the script. This technique was only able to work for me because my
                dataset was relatively small; however, on a larger dataset I would need to create more robust methods
                for interacting with outside data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Formatting data for use in the network visualization also was quite challenging. For some networks this
                was a straightforward process in Python which involved manipulating data to sparse matrix form and then
                writing functions to transform this network to a JSON object in the correct format. I assumed this
                technique would work across all countries until I ran into networks with over 500 nodes. Of course these
                networks would have to be cut down in order to display meaningfully with the rest of the project. Coding
                this thresholding rule in Python was the hardest part of the project because of the very specific way
                a network has to be encoded to render in D3.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each individual visualization was created in a few days by reading documentation and looking at blocks
                in which similar techniques are implemented. Challenges arose when combining visualizations and
                enabling interactivity between them. This was especially hard when getting the DataMaps package to
                interact with base D3 because the formatting and syntax is completely different in DataMaps functions.
                As previously stated, hard-coding values and finding other "hack-y" ways to deal with these problems
                turned out to be my best options. Perhaps if I felt as comfortable with javascript as I do with
                Python, my code would be more robust to issues like these.
